## Day 0: 15 Aug, 2018
Started Udacity's course: [Intro to Machine Learning]( https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120-india)

Completed Lesson 1: Welcome to Macine Learning.

Really excited and motivated to learn something extraordinarily with a discipline.

## Day 1: 16 Aug, 2018
completed half of Lesson 2: Naive bayes

Taking time for completing but instructors' explanation is really marvellous. They are involving real life examples and data to explain the things. Excited to continue this course.

## Day 2: 17 Aug, 2018
Completed Lesson2: Naive Bayes Algorithm. 

Doing a mini project which is given at the end of the Lesson: To find the author from their email writings. I need to implement Naive Bayes Algorithm to do this mini project in python.

Going well till now. The way the course set is wonderful. Every piece by piece of the concept is clearly explained by the instructors. Involving me in the quizzes made me understand very quickly and easily.

## Day 3: 18 Aug, 2018
Working on the mini project.

Setting up the required environment for the project. Downloading the data sets and project material needed for the project and for the course future activities.

Almost learnt nothing new today. Felt disappointing.

## Day 4: 19 Aug, 2018
Still working on the project.

Hard to solve but will be done for sure.

## Day 5: 20 Aug, 2018
Completed the project.

That was a very easy one. I wasn't got it yesterday. Anyhow delighted now for completing it. Going on to next Lesson SVM algorithm.

## Day 6: 21 Aug, 2018
Completed half of the Lesson SVMs: Support Vector Machines.

This is a gret algorithm which also solves the non-linear problems unlike naive_bayes. At the middle of lesson, Excited to move forward to know more about it and implement it.

## Day 7: 22 Aug, 2018
Got a mini project today. Project problem is same as the last one done with naive_bayes. Now I have to use SVC of SVM to solve the problem.

It's really taking a lot of time to train the data in my machine. It is reflecting in my learning pace. I couldn't move forward if it troubles me like this.

## Day 8: 23 Aug, 2018
Statrted a new video series by Daniel Shiffman from coding train, youtube.

Although it is based on javascript, but it is completely focusing on Machine Learning. Completed its first session 1: Algorithms and graphs earlier. Today headed over to session 2: Genetic Algorithms. 

To complete mini project, It is taking a lot of time to train and test the data. If I code wrong, modify it and try test run again, it takes a lot of time in my machine. So, I started a new series.

## Day 9: 24 Aug, 2018
 Completed two videos in the series and worked on them.
 
These videos focused on Evolutionary Computing, and more specifically, Genetic Algorithms. In this tutorial, I got introduced to the concept of a genetic algorithm, how it can be used to approach "search" problems and how it relates to brute force algorithms.

## Day 10: 25 Aug, 2018
Almost completed the second mini project.

A small problem in last task in the project which needed to be figured out. The ice is slowly breaking now. Everything started feeling familiar and feel like becoming a part of ML slowly.

## Day 11: 26 Aug, 2018
Completed the 2nd mini project successfully.

Solving problems, cracking them, understanding them and implementing them making things more clear. Anyway do and learn is really appreciable approach which is helping me understand the ML quickly and betterly.

## Day 12: 27 Aug, 2018
Learnt about Activation functions and Backpropagation algorithm.

Learnt and practised these concepts which have been taught in the class today. Understanding them to the clearer picture what they really do and what is their importance in Machine Learning.
 
## Day 13: 28 Aug, 2018
Completed half of the next Lesson: Decision Trees.

Going great. New algorithm Decision Trees making more sense and looks brilliant. Need to learn more.

## Day 14: 29 Aug, 2018
Revised the topics learnt till today.

OfCourse there is a lot more to learn but without remembering the learnt things will be just wasted. So, today's one hour is dedicated to revision and analysis of things learnt till today.

## Day 15: 30 Aug, 2018
Due to network problem, this commit has done with the next day's commit.

Practiced Neural Networks, Perceptron in program in python.

## Day 16: 31 Aug, 2018
Watched Genetic Algorithm video from the Youtube series.

Learnt and practiced the genetic algorithm: generating a desired string using genetic algorithm which uses 3 features - Heredity, Variation and Mutation.

This algorithm astonished me which Darwin found how species evaluate using those 3 features.

## Day 17: 1 Sep, 2018
Spent learning more about Genetic Algorithm: Shakespear Monkey problem, fitness function, improving fitness function, pool selection algorithm based on weights.

Coding something knowingly gives us more boosting as things are done by your awareness. This is situation I am in.

## Day 18: 2 Sep, 2018
Learnt Another algorithm for Pool selection, and interactive selection.

Literally you need a final output which is known, and you want it to built from scratch with some sort of algorithms or coding or something. Then this Genetic algorithm is very useful in that case.

Through interactive selection, we can design an output with the user's interaction or user's data. We can say, we can get the users feedback every time and improve our product every time. Finally we get a user's most desired output.

## Day 19: 3 Sep, 2018
Practiced Genetic Algorithm. Spent time to understand it properly and deeply.

Digging deep into Genetic algorithm is really widening my understanding. The more detailed understanding helps us in using it where it can be. Genetic algorithm came from the Darwinian theory that is from nature. So observing nature really solves our many problems. When somebody don't get solution they may find it in nature.

## Day 20: 4 Sep, 2018
Revised and practiced Neural Networks, Perceptron, Mcculloh-Pitts neuron, backpropagation algorithm, all with different activation functions by theoritically and implementing in python.

## Day 21: 5 Sep, 2018
Watched half of smart rockets project series by Daniel Shiffman in youtube.

This project is about an evolutionary steering behaviors coding challenge. The goal is to create a system where autonomous steering agents evolve the behavior of eating food (green dots) and avoiding poison (red dots).

## Day 22: 6 Sep, 2018
Tried to implement the same project which I watched yesterday but I supposed to know about steering behaviors to code this before. Because the rockets which finds food needs to change their path to food from their current going path.

I could not go completely in learning steering behaviors (it may make my path off the track) but tried to learn how the code work so that I could able to implement it.

Today spent checking the code, understanding it well.

## Day 23: 7 Sep, 2018
Completed all the series of the project. I am skipping implementation it beacause I am having Supervised and Unsupervised learning going on in my engineering class but I am going with Genetic Algorithms here So I could not fulfill the both.

This is the bad approach I have done. I shouldn't have had started this series but still I got good understanding of Genetic Algorithms.
Now, I am moving towards the new Session of Coding Train's Intelligence and Learning and need to complete Udacity's course I stopped it at Decision tree. I need to revert back to them.

## Day 24: 8 Sep, 2018
Completed Decision trees lesson, got an project to do.

Need to do the same project which have done in lesson 1 and 2 but this time, using decision tress.

## Day 25: 9 Sep, 2018
Completed  half of mini project. 

Project is easy but it takes time to complete. Nearly 10 - 15 mins for executing one time on my machine. If any mistake, the position is like, you are going to bear your time everytime. For every change and execute, it takes a lot time.

## Day 26: 10 Sep, 2018
Completed the whole mini project using decision trees. 

finally, Although it is taking time to complete, I could able to complete the project.

## Day 27: 11 Sep, 2018
Started Session 3: Intro to Machine Learning from the course of Intelligence and Learning of Coding Train by Daniel Shiffman.

Shiffman has his own way of explaining things. Honestly, I have got a clear cut overview of Machine Learning today. He has got videos which I haven't touched upon. This would help me in learning Machine Learning in different views.

## Day 28: 12 Sep, 2018
Started New Lesson "Choose Your Own Algorithm" of Udacity course.

This is not a teaching lesson but like a practical session. The purpose of this lesson is that I have to select my own algorithm and learn it and try to apply it to my data sets and get the accuracy. Their intention behind this lesson is that a Machine Learning Practioner should do the things on his own whatever they are trying make me do is the machine learning engineer does throught his ML journey.
