# 100DaysOfMLCode
This repo shows my daily activity of Machine Learning's 100DaysOfMLCode challenge. This is a challenge and pledge to study and learn Machine Learning at least  an hour daily.

Thanks for [Suryaprakash Reddy](https://github.com/SurajChinna) and Siraj Raval from YouTube for this idea and initive.

## Day 0: 15 Aug, 2018
Started Udacity's course: [Intro to Machine Learning]( https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120-india)

Completed Lesson 1: Welcome to Macine Learning.

Really excited and motivated to learn something extraordinarily with a discipline.

## Day 1: 16 Aug, 2018
completed half of Lesson 2: Naive bayes

Taking time for completing but instructors' explanation is really marvellous. They are involving real life examples and data to explain the things. Excited to continue this course.

## Day 2: 17 Aug, 2018
Completed Lesson2: Naive Bayes Algorithm. 

Doing a mini project which is given at the end of the Lesson: To find the author from their email writings. I need to implement Naive Bayes Algorithm to do this mini project in python.

Going well till now. The way the course set is wonderful. Every piece by piece of the concept is clearly explained by the instructors. Involving me in the quizzes made me understand very quickly and easily.

## Day 3: 18 Aug, 2018
Working on the mini project.

Setting up the required environment for the project. Downloading the data sets and project material needed for the project and for the course future activities.

Almost learnt nothing new today. Felt disappointing.

## Day 4: 19 Aug, 2018
Still working on the project.

Hard to solve but will be done for sure.
