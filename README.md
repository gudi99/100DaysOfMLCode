# 100DaysOfMLCode
This repo shows my daily activity of Machine Learning's 100DaysOfMLCode challenge. This is a challenge and pledge to study and learn Machine Learning at least  an hour daily.

Thanks for [Suryaprakash Reddy](https://github.com/SurajChinna) and Siraj Raval from YouTube for this idea and initive.

## Day 0: 15 Aug, 2018
Started Udacity's course: [Intro to Machine Learning]( https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120-india)

Completed Lesson 1: Welcome to Macine Learning.

Really excited and motivated to learn something extraordinarily with a discipline.

## Day 1: 16 Aug, 2018
completed half of Lesson 2: Naive bayes

Taking time for completing but instructors' explanation is really marvellous. They are involving real life examples and data to explain the things. Excited to continue this course.

## Day 2: 17 Aug, 2018
Completed Lesson2: Naive Bayes Algorithm. 

Doing a mini project which is given at the end of the Lesson: To find the author from their email writings. I need to implement Naive Bayes Algorithm to do this mini project in python.

Going well till now. The way the course set is wonderful. Every piece by piece of the concept is clearly explained by the instructors. Involving me in the quizzes made me understand very quickly and easily.

## Day 3: 18 Aug, 2018
Working on the mini project.

Setting up the required environment for the project. Downloading the data sets and project material needed for the project and for the course future activities.

Almost learnt nothing new today. Felt disappointing.

## Day 4: 19 Aug, 2018
Still working on the project.

Hard to solve but will be done for sure.

## Day 5: 20 Aug, 2018
Completed the project.

That was a very easy one. I wasn't got it yesterday. Anyhow delighted now for completing it. Going on to next Lesson SVM algorithm.

## Day 6: 21 Aug, 2018
Completed half of the Lesson SVMs: Support Vector Machines.

This is a gret algorithm which also solves the non-linear problems unlike naive_bayes. At the middle of lesson, Excited to move forward to know more about it and implement it.

## Day 7: 22 Aug, 2018
Got a mini project today. Project problem is same as the last one done with naive_bayes. Now I have to use SVC of SVM to solve the problem.

It's really taking a lot of time to train the data in my machine. It is reflecting in my learning pace. I couldn't move forward if it troubles me like this.

## Day 8: 23 Aug, 2018
Statrted a new video series by Daniel Shiffman from coding train, youtube.

Although it is based on javascript, but it is completely focusing on Machine Learning. Completed its first session 1: Algorithms and graphs earlier. Today headed over to session 2: Genetic Algorithms. 

To complete mini project, It is taking a lot of time to train and test the data. If I code wrong, modify it and try test run again, it takes a lot of time in my machine. So, I started a new series.

## Day 9: 24 Aug, 2018
 Completed two videos in the series and worked on them.
 
These videos focused on Evolutionary Computing, and more specifically, Genetic Algorithms. In this tutorial, I got introduced to the concept of a genetic algorithm, how it can be used to approach "search" problems and how it relates to brute force algorithms.

## Day 10: 25 Aug, 2018
Almost completed the second mini project.

A small problem in last task in the project which needed to be figured out. The ice is slowly breaking now. Everything started feeling familiar and feel like becoming a part of ML slowly.

## Day 11: 26 Aug, 2018
Completed the 2nd mini project successfully.

Solving problems, cracking them, understanding them and implementing them making things more clear. Anyway do and learn is really appreciable approach which is helping me understand the ML quickly and betterly.

## Day 12: 27 Aug, 2018
Learnt about Activation functions and Backpropagation algorithm.

Learnt and practised these concepts which have been taught in the class today. Understanding them to the clearer picture what they really do and what is their importance in Machine Learning.
 
## Day 13: 28 Aug, 2018
Completed half of the next Lesson: Decision Trees.

Going great. New algorithm Decision Trees making more sense and looks brilliant. Need to learn more.
